          Hey! I'm Kushagra and I enjoy solving coding challenges, building simple yet functional tools, and exploring backend development. I’m currently learning how to create efficient and scalable applications using Python, and I love turning ideas into working projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thanks to my creativity, my attention to detail and my determination,
          I realized that I have a great talent for developing applications.
          I am fascinated by this great world of technologies and possibilities,
          and I am sure that I will be able to create incredible projects both
          professionally and personally with you.
